Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
Impossible to see... The Dark Side clouds everything.
But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will.
With you the force is strong... young Senator.
To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics.
Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help.
Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future.
Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force.
Help you, it will.
Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.
Master UNK UNK, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
What help to you, can I be?
An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings.
Master UNK has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
Most interesting.
Gravity’s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared.
How can this be?
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered.
To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
Much harder to answer, that question is.
The Council is confident in this decision, UNK.
Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
Inform the chancellor of this, we must.
With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.
Two Hundred... less or more.
Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send.
Enough, let's hope they are.
Come on - hurry! Hurry!
More battalions to the left.
Encircle them we must, then divide.
Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have.
The end for you, Count, this is.
Victory? Victory, you say?
Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master UNK.
Begun, the Clone War has!
Hmm. That face you make.
Look I so old to young eyes?
I do, yes, I do! 
Sick have I become.
Old and weak.
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?
Soon will I rest.
Yes, forever sleep.
Earned it, I have.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong!
Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall.
That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require.
Already know you that which you need.
Oh. Not yet. One thing remains: UNK.
You must confront UNK.
And confront him you will.
Then, only then, a Jedi will you be.
Hmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
Your father he is.
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training.
Not ready for the burden were you.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
But beware.
Anger, fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.
Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Luke... Luke... Do not... Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will.
Luke, when gone am I (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be.
Luke, the Force runs strong in your family.
Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is... another... UNK.
Premonitions... premonitions... Hmm... these visions you have...
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
... close to you?
Careful you must be when sensing the future, UNK.
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.
Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not.
Disturbing is this move by Chancellor UNK.
Hiding in the Outer Rim, UNK is.
The outlying systems, you must sweep.
Master UNK, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
Go, I will.
Good relations with the UNK, I have.
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. 
Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
A prophecy... that misread could have been.
I hope right you are. And now destroy the UNK armies on UNK, I will.
May the Force be with you.
Act on this, we must.
The capture of General UNK will end this war.
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
A Master is needed, with more experience.
UNK, my choice is.
Then now the time is, Commander.
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.
Hmm... great care we must take.
Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
Not far, are we, from the emergency ship.
Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
Master UNK, dark times are these.
Good to see you. it is.
With the help of the UNK, barely escape, I did.
Heard from no one, have we.
Received a coded retreat message, we have.
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
In a dark place we find ourselves... a little more knowledge might light our way.
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
Dismantle the coded signal quickly.
That group back there, soon discovered will be.
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
Good... For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take.
To change it back, longer still.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
Destroy the Sith, we must.
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become.
The boy you trained, gone he is... Consumed by Darth UNK.
To question, no time there is.
Use your feelings, UNK, and find him, you will.
Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
If so powerful you are, why leave?
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Destroy you I will, just as Master UNK, your apprentice will destroy.
Careful timing we will need.
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have. Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have.
Still much to learn, there is...
Eternal consciousness.
...to become one with the Force, and influence still have... A power greater than all, it is.
A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn.
Your apprentice I gratefully become.
Save them, we must. Our last hope they are.
Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
Split up, they should be.
To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line.
Hope, we can... Done, it is.
Until the time is right, disappear we will.
In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me... your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied.
How to commune with him, I will teach you.
How to join the Force, he will train you.
Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force.
Even your physical self, perhaps.
Feel like what?
Away with your weapon!  I mean you no harm.
I am wondering, why are you here?
Looking?  Found someone, you have, I would say, hmm?
Help you I can hmm.
A great warrior. Wars not make one great.
How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
Aww, cannot get your ship out?
I will help you not.
Stay and help you, I will.
Find your friend, hmm?
Hmm Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes, but now, eat we must.
Come, come.
Soon with him you will be.
Rootleaf, I cook.
Why wish you become Jedi Hmm?
Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, hmm.
I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
Hmm Much anger in him, like his father.
Ready, he is not.
Ready, are you?  What know you of ready?
For eight hundred years have I trained knight.
My own council will I keep on who is to be trained!
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmm.
Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A knight craves not these things. You are reckless!
He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
Will he finished what he begins ?
Oh, you will be. You will be.
Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression.
The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.
If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did UNK's apprentice.
No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, more seductive.
You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive.
A knight uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions Hmm Hmm.
That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
Use the Force. Yes...
Now... the stone, feel it.
So certain are you.
Always with you it cannot be done.
Hear you nothing that I say?
No different, only different in your mind.  You must unlearn what you have learned.
Try not, do or do not, there is no try.
Size matters not.  Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm?  Hmm.
And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. 
Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us.
Luminous beings are we... not this crude matter.
The Force around you, you must feel
Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
That is why you fail.
Concentrate... feel the Force flow.
Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends long gone.
Hmm. Control, control. Control you must learn. 
Hmm.  Friends there, you have.
It is the future you see.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future.
How to serve them best, decide you must.
If you leave now, help them you could. But all for which they have fought and suffered, destroy you would.
Luke! Complete the training you must.
You must not go!
Yes, yes, to UNK you listen. The cave, remember your failure at the cave!
Stopped they must be.  On this all depends.
Only a fully trained Knight as his ally will conquer UNK and his Emperor. 
Become an agent of evil you will.
If what they fight for you honor... yes!
Strong is UNK.  Mind what you have learned, save you it can.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he.  Now matters are worse.
There is another.
The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must.
With this queen you must stay, UNK protect her, he will.
May the Force be with you.
More to say have you?
A vergence, you say?
But you do, Revealed your opinion is.
Trained as a knight, request for him you do ?
Tested he will be.
Good, good, young one. How feel you?
Afraid are you?
See through you, we can.
Afraid to lose her...I think.
Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
The deepest commitment, the most serious mind, a Jedi must have. Much fear in you I sense.
Then continue, we will.
...Correct you were...
Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
An apprentice, you have. Impossible, to take on a second, it is.
Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has...
And draw out the Queen's attacker.
Young boy's fate will be decided later.
Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
May the Force be with you.
Confer on you, the level of Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your learner, I do not.
The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
Defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young boy will be.
Always two there are... no more... no less. A master and an apprentice.
Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
Impossible to see... The Dark Side clouds everything.
But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will.
To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.

Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future.
Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
Help you, it will.
Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.

Suggest decrypting the coded signal, do you?
In an obscure place we find ourselves... a little more knowledge might light our path.
If an extraordinary session of Congress there is, less difficult for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
Decrypte the coded signal quickly.
That band back there, soon discovered will be.
Slayed not by clones, this knight. By a lightsaber, he was.
Good... Long before the Clones discover the recalibration, it will take.
To change it back, even longer.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
Destroy the UNK, we have to.
Not strong enough to defy this Lord, you are.
Twisted by the obscure side, young UNK has become.
The boy you teached, gone he is... Consumed by UNK.
To ask, no time there is.
Use your senses, UNK, and find him, you will.
See the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
I hear a new student, you have. Emperor, or should I call you UNK.
Not if anything I have to say about this.
Finally your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
If so powerful you are, why go?
Faith in your new student, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Destroy you I will, just as Mister UNK, your student will destroy.
Accurate timing we will need.
Into exile I need to go. Unsucceed, I have.  Unsucceed to stop the Lord, I have.
Still many things to learn, there are...
...to become one with the Force, and influence still have... A power bigger than all, it is.
A good mister, you have become.
Your student I gratefully become.
Rescue them, we must. Our last hope they are.
Pregnant, she must still look like. Hidden, safe, the child must be kept.
Separated, they should be.
To UNK, To his parents, send him.
Powerful the Force runs, in the Skywalker line.
Believe we can, It is done
Until the time is perfect, disappear we will.
In your isolation on UNK, training I have for you.
An former friend has learned the path to immortality.
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me... your old teacher.
The secret of the Ancient Order of the UNK, he examined.
How to discuss with him, I will teach you.
How to join the Force, he will teach you.
Your awareness you will retain, when one with the Force.
Even your physical self, maybe.
Away with your sword!  I mean you no harm.
I am asking, why are you here?
A great fighter. Wars not make one great.
Aww, cannot get your vessel out?
Stay here and help you, I will.
Find your brother, hmm?
Hmm Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes, but now, feed we must.
Soon around him you will be.
Why want you become knight Hmm?
Ah, your uncle,  powerful knight was he, powerful knight hmm.
I cannot train him. The boy has no patience.
Hmm Much fury in him, like his father.
Completed, he is not.
Completed, are you?  What know you of completed?
For eight hundred years have I teached knight.
My own board will I keep on who is to be trained!
A knight must have the deepest engagement, the most serious mind.
This one a long time have I contempleted. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon.
Never his attention on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmm.
Adventure. Heh! Enthusiasm! Heh! A knight desires not these things. You are careless!
He is too old. Yes, too old to start the training.
Will he achieve what he begins ?
Run! Yes. A knight's power flows from the Force.
But careful of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression.
The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, fast to join you in a fight.
If once you arise the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did UNK's student.
No... no... no.  Faster, easier, more seductive.
You will understand. When you are calm, at peace. Passive.
A knight uses the Force for wisdom and defense, never for attack.
No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Free your mind of questions Hmm Hmm.
That place... is powerful with the dark side of the Force. A field of evil it is. In you must go.
Only what you cary with you.
So sure are you.
Always with you it cannot be accomplished.
No different, only different in your head.  You must forget what you have learned.
Try not, do or do not, there is no test.
Height matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my height, do you? Hmm?  Hmm.
And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a strong ally it is. 
Life creates it, makes it grow. Its light surrounds us and binds us.
Luminous beings are we... not this raw material.
The Force around you, you must sense.
Here, between you... me... the tree... the stone... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that vessel!
That is why you unsuccesseed.
Focus... feel the Force flow.
Through the Force, things you will discover. Other places. The future... the past. Former friends long gone.
Hmm.  Allies there, you have.
Difficult to see.  Always moving is the future.
Hard to see.  Always in motion is the future.
How to serve them best, choose you must.
If you go now, help them you could. But all for which they have fought and suffered, destroy you would.
Luke! Finish the training you must.
You must not leave!
Yes, yes, to UNK you listen. The cavern, remember your failure at the cavern!
Stopped they have to be.  On this all depends.
Only a perfectly trained Knight as his ally will conquer UNK and his Emperor. 
Become an henchman of evil you will.
If what they fight for you respect... yes!
Powerful is UNK.  Mind what you have learned, save you it can.
Told you, I did.  Careless is he.  Now matters are worse.
The very Republic is endangered, if involved the UNK are.
Hard to see, the dark side is. Find out who this assassin is, we must.
Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this killer is, we must.
Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this murderer is, we must.
Difficult to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must.
A agreement you say?
But you do, Revealed your assessment is.
Trained as a knight, question for him you do ?
Tried he will be.
Frightened are you?
Read you, we can.
Frightened to lose her...I think.
Afraid to lose her... I guess
Fear is the path to the obscure side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to pain.
The deepest engagement, the most serious mind, a knight must have. Much fear in you I sense.
The deepest commitment, the most serious mind, a knight must have. Much fear in you I feel.
Then go on, we will.
...Right you were...
Shadowed, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
A student, you have. Impossible, to take on a second, it is.
Our own board we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has...
And draw out the Queen's assailant.
Young boy's destiny will be decided later.
Teach him not. Take him with you, but teach him not!
Trust you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your learner, I do not.
The Chosen One the boy may be; however, grave danger I fear in his training.
Defiance I feel in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young boy will be.
Defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the board does. Your apprentice, young boy will be.
Defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your student, young boy will be.
Always two there are... no more... no less. A master and a student.
